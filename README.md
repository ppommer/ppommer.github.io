# Website

This is the source code of my website currently hosted under https://ppommer.github.io.
It is based on an open source clone of tailwind's [Spotlight](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/templates/spotlight/preview) template provided by [thatsdc](https://github.com/thatsdc).

## Dev setup

Run `npm install` to install dependencies followed by `npm start` to start the dev setup with auto-reload running under http://localhost:3000.

## Production deployment

Run `npm deploy` to check out the code to the `gh-pages` branch and auto-deploy.
